# Paper FOSS Icons
This icon theme based on the two GTK Icon Themes, [Paper from Sam Hewitt](https://github.com/snwh/paper-icon-theme) and [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme). It's aiming to provide a consistent and minimalistic look to your device.

## Icons
Only apps from the F-Droid Store will be supported.

## Icon Request
Please request icons for your apps.

## How can I contribute?
There are many ways:
1) Do icon requests for missing icons!
2) Choose icon from the base theme, papirus, and add it to the repo with a pull request for a fdroid app.
3) Create new icons that not be support by papirus, by mixing one with the parts of the existing one.
